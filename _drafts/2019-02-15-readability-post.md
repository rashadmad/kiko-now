## Why Read this

* If you aren't familiar with CRUD and want to learn more about it.
* If you are new to Ruby on Rails and want a primer
* just like my blog and want to support me :)

I will be working on a project in Ruby on Rails so I am going to need to be familiar with it. In particular how CRUD works in ruby on Rails. So what I will be doing is creating a blog in ruby on rails to gain familiarity

## What is CRUD
---

Basically crud is an programming acronym for

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

You are using crud all over the web everyday. Twitter is a great example of crud

![twitter=crud](https://media.giphy.com/media/uTjpIPVMaYlBS/giphy.gif)

In twitter you
* _Create_ (to write a tweet)
* _Read_ (You write the tweet so it can be read by others)
* _Update_ (Twitter purposely does not allow you to edit your tweets. Just think if you retweet something nice and it was edited to be something mean that would suck)
* _Delete_ (Often people want to destroy the things that they create when they are not proud of it)

I wont be creating a twitter clone, instead something more inline to the other things in this blog... a blog

## Ruby on Rails blog walkthrough
---

First off If you want to go through this with me I would follow along with these set of treehouse tutorials by Jay McGavren [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-on-rails-5-basics)

if you don't have a treehouse account I do suggest it. It is a great tool for learning a great deal about WebDevelopment sign-up [here](http://referrals.trhou.se/rashadmadison) its only like $25 bucks a month. If you don't have a treehouse account don't stress you can still get a great deal out of this.

I am not going to go over setting up ruby and rails on your system here is a good resource for that https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html

### Once you have Ruby and rails both installed

open up a terminal that can run ruby and enter or create a directory for your project in that directory enter

```
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
