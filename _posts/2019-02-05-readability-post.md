Development diary 1: Kelly's health blog

So I stated in my last post that I was going to go over how Jekyll works. I was thinking a tutorial would be my best bet. But after watching [Mike Dane's Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) I think if you want a "How to" on Jekyll he does a great job. For these blog posts I instead want to focus on the experience that I have using Jekyll as a tool to solve a problem. The problem being developing a [squeeze page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_page) / [Blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) for a client. This will be the first part of multiple post on the on my experience:

* gathering a clients needs, In other words what is the problem the client needs solved
* Choosing the best tools to solve a clients problem
* developing a solution
* Pricing and receiving payment for the solution

## Why write this

I have to admit that I have difficulties with the dealing with client. I am quite comfortable creating applications, websites and tinkering but when it comes to pricing, communicating or simply giving the client what they want things can become dicey for me.

## Clients suck

yes they do, They can very much be a pain to deal with. Ego always becomes an obstacle when dealing with them and they never quite speak your language. With that said obviously people from all over the world are pleasing clients every day, so I have to accept that I must be doing something wrong. Yes.....I have to take responsibility because that is why a client seeks you out in the first place. They have a thing they need done that they can't or won't do and they want some one else to do it.

So I am on a mission to solve this clients problem at all cost. I know I will have to hold this persons hand for things that seem elementary to me all the while making sure they feel superior.

## Happy clients = $$

_Alright I am done ranting_, honestly my best bet is empathizing with this person, they need help and asking for help is one of the hardest things a person can do. I am committed to completing the task of making this client happy _at all cost_ So follow me on my journey to develop a health blog that brings in revenue for the client and gives them a solid web presence.
