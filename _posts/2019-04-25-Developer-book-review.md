Review of: **A mind for numbers how to excel at math and science**

Today I will be going over a book that was suggested to me by a mentor. After multiple hacking sessions together he saw the need for me to reframe the way I go about solving problems. As a person who puts forth a great deal of effort but doesn't necessarily get back the dividends from those efforts. I see the need to be more strategic about my cognitive processes. If you can relate I highly suggest this book by Barbara Oakley, PH.D.

## Why read a mind for numbers
I will admit it seems more logical to read books tailored to learning a specific language or to something much more computer _sciencey_. But when it comes to books its always advantageous to go back to *basics*. This book may be intended for students trying to be better at math and science but as a developer often its not about being a better developer but a better student of development. The book focuses on you solving problems and having the proper thought patterns to learn how to be a better problem solver.

## Creating Chunks
Chunking is at the cornerstone of learning and problem solving. Basically creating chunks is how you take a bunch of data and simplify it so you can remember it. (memory is a big part of learning). A great example is coming up with a silly metaphor or story to assist you in learning something.

### My MVC metaphor
____
Here is an example of me creating an abstract representation for the MVC acronym (model view controller, the _architectural pattern_ in app development).

* **Model** A bunch of _lego_ blocks stacked on each other made to look like a building.
* **View** A _painting_ that represents the building the lego blocks are shaped like.  
* **Controller:** A _squid_ manipulating the blocks and painting the painting that represents the blocks.

even though this is quite an abstraction from what mvc really is. It reminds me that the model is structured data, The controller is the in between of both of the view and model, The view being a painting reminds me(as an artist that it is my favorite part)it needs to be presentable to the client.

As my understanding of mvc grows I may make changes to the metaphor but what is important is developing and testing my own tactics in chunking down information in to digestible chunks for my memory.

### Diffuse thinking vs focused thinking
_____
There are many ways of creating chunks. Using both focussed and diffuse thinking are the tools suggested in the book. Problem solving consist of finding the right chunks for the task.
  * **Focussed:**
  This thought process is high conscious and deliberate. great for memorizing data. The grind it out form of learning. This gathers new information and forms new chunks.

  * **Diffuse:**
  Is the auto-pilot of learning. Have you ever solved a problem while siting on a toilet or during lunch when you aren't even working on the problem directly. This is a subconscious way of connecting chunks together.

focussed learning builds the chunks and diffuse learning gives you "ah-ha" moments when you rest and you have multiple chunks that get together and give you a more holistic understanding.

#### How do you use this to become a better developer
_____
An obstacle for developers solving problems is doing so while on some one else's time. Developers and engineers get paid quite a bit for there time. Unfortunately this can lead to you leaning on focussed learning when attempting to solve a problem. Though you can get quite a bit done with focused learning, Barbara Oakley brings up the point that one can actually accomplish much more going in-and-out of focussed and diffuse learning.

How would this work? Well you would _STOP_ working. Or to be more specific you would take
 consistent breaks through out your work day. She even suggests the Pomodoro technique which is one that I have prescribed too for a while. If you are not familiar with it check it out [here](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/the-pomodoro-technique).

 You have to find time to take breaks from your work. consistent breaks really will make you a better problem solver because it allows you to go into diffuse thinking mode and really connect those information chunks.

### Dealing with Procrastination  
___
The book also brings up the subject of procrastination. I was under the assumption that procrastination wasn't an issue for me. But, In the digital age you just have so many things at your finger tips to distract you from your work. A good tactic to avoiding the many distractions is to turn technology against itself and use the many apps at your disposal to cut you off from unnecessary noise. Here is a list of different productivity apps. [10 apps that block distractions](https://wallstreetinsanity.com/10-apps-that-block-distractions/)

The biggest tid-bit of advice in the book was a oldie but a goodie:

> _"eat you frogs first"_

When you have something to do that you have low interest in but it is vital that you complete it. Attack it first and give your self a pat on the back for getting through it.

### Connecting this with software development
___
Some developers hate writing test. They find it unnecessary and boring. But not only is it important to write test it really helps when you do it _first_. It then can define how you code the rest of the program. Also can make life easier while developing.

## I highly suggest the book

Even if you aren't a developer most jobs involve obstacles that need solving. Your success will most likely have a connection with how well you traverse those obstacles.
