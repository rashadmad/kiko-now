# My experience as an applicant to the Outreachy internship program **Part-One**
Synopsis of my experience as a Outreachy applicant: **I made it to the contribution period**

## What is Outreachy

[Click this to go to the outrechy website](https://www.outreachy.org/).
____
*Outreachy is a paid, remote internship program. Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in tech. We help newcomers to free software and open source make their first contributions.*

*Outreachy provides internships to work open source. People apply from all around the world. Interns work remotely, and are not required to move. Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 USD for the three month internship. Interns have a $500 USD travel stipend to attend conferences or events.*

*Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science. Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.*

*Outreachy expressly invites applicants who are women (both cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people to apply. We also expressly invite applications who are residents and nationals of the United States of America of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. Anyone who faces systemic bias or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.*

## Why I Decided To Apply
I consider my self a unique person to say the least. My experience as a developer definitely shows that. I did not get a computer science degree nor did I participate in a bootcamp. I have gone the non-traditional route and outreachy seems very much like a non-traditional internship. Also from my experience networking and meeting people in the development world I often feel like an oddball.

### Contributing To Creative Commons Project

For the outreachy application I had to choose an open source project to contribute to. I really wanted to do something that involved frontend development. I choose this project.

#### Intro to the Vocabulary project
![project](/images/outReachyProject.png)

## Why I Picked This Project
I decided to work on this project because it mentioned vue.js experience. It is at a "2" which gives me the opportunity to learn vue.js while working which sounded great. I had plenty of experience with JavaScript and english also is not an issue for me. 

I saw this project as an opportunity to learn a frontend framework and also get some open source experience.

### First Time Working On A Design System
____
*Vocabulary is a cohesive design system to unite the web facing Creative Commons. Vocabulary makes it easier to develop Creative Commons apps while ensuring a consistently familiar experience.*

I have worked on a few websites and some applications but never a design system. I have had interest in them for years now. I just love the idea of createing modular solutions ahead of time and bringing thoses solutions together to create applications. 

## Excited To Take On A New Challenge

After fumbling around in the issues section attempting a few issues that were over my head I settled upon createing double range slider.

### Double Range Slider

So the task I have at hand is to create a double range slider component with the Vue.js framework.

#### To be continued 

I will go in to more detail about my work on the slider an my experience in my next blog post.
