Introducing Rashads Development Blog

Hello all, My name is Rashad and I am a young front-end developer who is looking to break in-to web development industry. This blog will be a way for me to chart my experiences on my mission to find gainful employment. Also I have felt really selfish over the years using a ton of tutorials and not making any. As a new year's resolution I plan to make at least a few before the year is out. To get to know me visit my [about](/about) page

## I Love Jekyll When It Comes To Blogging

I built this blog in Jekyll and so far I am enjoying my experience. I don't want to speak ill of other popular frameworks like Wordpress. But I feel that it can be quite bloated and slow. Wordpress has been around for a long time and can at times feel that way (_OLD_).

Wordpress is actually pretty solid when you need to create something for others who don't necessarily code. That was not necessary for my blog.

### So Why Did I Choose Jekyll?

over the years working with different frameworks and constantly asking my self the question "what is the best way to make a website?" I have found there is no simple answer. It's all about what your priorities are on a project.
* Speed: how quick can I get my product to the user
* Usability: how quickly can I get my product created, Also do you want your client to use some sort of wysiwyg
* Functionality: do I need a blog, Newsletter, ads, eCommerce etc

#### Jekyll pros

* I wanted a rich selection of themes.
* Jekyll synergies with Github pages which I use often.(also its free)
* I have interest in getting comfortable with ruby for a *up and coming project(stay tuned)*.
* I already have experience writing in markdown. (Which is what Jekyll uses for blog post)

Thats basically why I choose Jekyll Next time on my blog I will go over the ins and outs of Jekyll. The over all experience that I had getting it up to production and any tips I can share.
